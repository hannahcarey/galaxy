I am reading Daniel Shiffman's Nature of Code, https://natureofcode.com/random/
In chapter 0, I learned about the walker class and was inspired to experiment with it, introducing differing colors and blend modes.
this program runs 8 walkers that will cover your screen with beautiful colors, while displaying some stars as well, representing a galaxy.

To run from VS code, please install the p5.vscode extension, right-click on index.html, and choose Open with Live Server. you might need to manually access http://localhost:5500/ in your browser

In the future I would like to add user input functionality, allowing for the user to choose colors/number of walkers/ etc.
I also want to have a similar dark texture in the background, but I found generating that texture with a walker to be inappropriate.

here are some examples I generated. 11/9/2024
